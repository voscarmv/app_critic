# AppCritic

> An app for sharing criticism and ratings of apps.

This is an MVP version of twitter. I've adapted it to share opinions about specific apps. Users can add a new app for everyone to critique, and they can follow eachother as well.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you [install Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) and have the following packages installed before continuing:

```
$ gem install bundler rspec 
```


### Install

To test AppCritic locally, clone the repository, navigate to it's containing directory, and run:

```
$ bundle install
$ rails db:migrate
```

This should install all ruby gems. Make sure you also have a proper `application.yml` file with your [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/rails_integration) credentials. Example:

```
---
development:
  cloud_name: my_cloud_name
  api_key: '123123132123123'
  api_secret: xqPEy_xXxXxXXXxxxxXXXXxxXXx
  enhance_image_tag: true
  static_file_support: false
production:
  cloud_name: my_cloud_name
  api_key: '123123132123123'
  api_secret: xqPEy_xXxXxXXXxxxxXXXXxxXXx
  enhance_image_tag: true
  static_file_support: true
test:
  cloud_name: my_cloud_name
  api_key: '123123132123123'
  api_secret: xqPEy_xXxXxXXXxxxxXXXXxxXXx
  enhance_image_tag: true
  static_file_support: false

```

### Run tests

Running `rspec` will test AppCritic's functionalities. Navigate the `spec` directory to find out how the tests are performed.

### Deployment
