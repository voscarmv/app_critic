# AppCritic

> An app for sharing criticism and ratings of apps.

This is an MVP version of twitter. I've adapted it to share opinion about specific apps. User can add a new app for everyone to critique, they can follow eachother as well.

  api_key: '123123132123123'
  api_secret: xqPEy_xXxXxXXXxxxxXXXXxxXXx
  enhance_image_tag: true
  static_file_support: false
production:
  cloud_name: my_cloud_name
  api_key: '123123132123123'
  api_secret: xqPEy_xXxXxXXXxxxxXXXXxxXXx
  enhance_image_tag: true
  static_file_support: true
test:
  cloud_name: my_cloud_name
  api_key: '123123132123123'
  api_secret: xqPEy_xXxXxXXXxxxxXXXXxxXXx
  enhance_image_tag: true
  static_file_support: false

```

## Acknowledgments

- I used the [Slack Ruby Bot](https://github.com/slack-ruby/slack-ruby-bot) framework to lay the code foundation for the project.
- I used parts of the code from the [stackoverflow gem](https://github.com/antoviaque/stack-overflow-command-line) to query StackOverflow questions by using the [StackExchange API](https://api.stackexchange.com/docs/similar)
- I also used parts of the code from [fortune_gem](https://github.com/nodanaonlyzuul/fortune_gem) to build my implementation of `fortune`.
- I copied the contents of the fortune files from the [fortune-mod ubuntu package](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/fortune-mod) into my `lib/fortunes` file for my `fortune` implementation.
- I created [a prototype](https://github.com/voscarmv/stackoverflow_slack_bot/tree/feature-branch) before this project using git submodules of the aforementioned packages. I've left it in my repositories for reference.
